Release builds are for beta testing
Production builds are for full releases

So if you intend to do any UAT please mark on Github as pre-release and publish the "Release" build type

Note:
    Test builds are for quick builds, to ensure your change runs

    Debug builds are for complex debugging, to allow you to use all debugging features
    
    Release builds are for simple releases, to push versions out that aren't bleeding-edge
    
    Prod builds are for full releases, these use the maximum optimizations, and are for scheduled releases only

Version numbers are as follows:

    V{version_variant}.{version_major}.{version_minor}.{version_patch}

    These follow the Vulkan spec for versioning

    Production builds will only have this version numbering system, pre-releases
    will use the following system:
        VX.X.X.X-alpha (closed invite-only release)
        VX.X.X.X-beta (open limited release)
        VX.X.X.X-release-candidate (full release preview)
        The patch number for these versions is used to denote the progression of these versions
        
        Patch version numbers will increment for every release of that Variant, Major, Minor branch
        Minor version numbers will only increment with feature releases
        Major version numbers will only increment with compatibility-breaking/large feature releases
        Variant version numbers will only increment with full overhauls or major changes to gameplay/functionality

        Releases and advertising must be agreed upon unanimously by primary maintainers
         (currently Kane Cross and Cristi Pogar)
